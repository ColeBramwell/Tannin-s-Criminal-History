            In 2017 at the age of two he served his first night in prison after being caught by a fellow student while publicly intoxicated, the first of many long nights in a cell. This alcoholism became a theme in his life from a young age and many say that it was most likely the main factor contributing towards his criminal activity. At the age of 2.5 he defied authority once again by staying up until 7:32 when his bedtime, as clearly stated by his parents, was 7:30. At 2.6 years of age he stole candy from New World, resulting in a 2 year ban. From there, Tannin went on to attempt the crime that would be his downfall; breaking in to the local Foursquare to steal what he refers to as "Jelle Babbies"
