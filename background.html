            Tannin Heeley was born on February 29, 2004, making him 3 years old and therefore the youngest criminal to be currently on death row. He was a troubled child, often partaking in activities such as locking his peers in the school storage basement, resulting in expulsion from 5 separate primary schools. This forced his family to move around the country in search of new schools. His parents began to develop disdain for their son, often attempting to dissociate from him in conversations and in public. His little brother, Requis, was the perfect child and stole the spotlight on almost every occassion which only drove Tannin further towards the edge.
