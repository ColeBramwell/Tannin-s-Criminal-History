            Tannin Heeley was born on February 29, 2004, making him 3 years old and therefore the youngest criminal to be currently on death row. He was a troubled child, often partaking in activities such as locking his peers in the school storage basement, resulting in expulsion from 5 separate primary schools. This forced his family to move around the country in search of new schools. In 2017 at the age of two he served his first night in prison after being caught be a fellow student while publicly intoxicated, the first of many long nights in a cell. Some of his gateway crimes include:

            <ul>
                <li>He stole candy from New World (2 year ban)</li>
                <li>He went to bed at 7:32 when his bed time was 7:30 <a href=https://www.wikihow.com/Discipline-a-Child target="_blank">(needs a beating)</a>
                </li>
                <li>His mugshot looks suspicious (not a gateway crime but certainly a contributing factor)</li>
            </ul>
